            content="88% of global C-level executives and IT decision-makers believe companies incorporate AI because it’s trendy, but most don’t actually know how to use it1. It may not always be obvious that data sets the foundation for AI, but it provides the strength to build tailored customer experiences, targeted communications, increased engagement and more. Clients also tell us they’re overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of their data, with many lacking the tools and skills required to use it to solve their business problems – but it doesn’t have to be like this."

            content="- Identify a data champion; someone who’s passionate about the uses of data and the wider project. They’ll help to convince others to get on board. He or she should be part of the senior level or executive management, which means they’ll have the vision, as well as the budget, to make things happen."

            content="The first step to understanding your data, or improving your existing data management practices, sounds basic – but it’s arguably the most important step to getting ready for AI: take stock. Ask yourself what kind of data has already been captured. Is it structured data from internal CRM, ERP or customer service channels? Or is it unstructured data that circulates in the public domain via social media, shared documents, and videos? Evaluate how your data is being captured and understand if there’s any governance in place. Identify any processes that help to ensure high data quality. Add tags or metadata to categorize and record key information, like which departments currently use a certain data field. It could be as simple as creating a master spreadsheet inventory to record your findings in one place. It’ll become a valuable asset as you continue this journey."

            content="You’ve now created an inventory of your data to answer your business problem. You know what information you have to work with. What’s next? Define your hypothesis. Look at your data’s potential value and understand how it relates to your business goals and challenges. Next, think of ways to organize this data into manageable chunks and consider how they’ll begin to support your overarching objectives. Taking this incremental, more agile approach to analysis will help you avoid complexity as your data and business success builds."

            title="Keep your eyes on the prize"
            content="Most organizations attempt to collect every bit of data they can, saving and storing it just in case. There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s a good thing because it can be cataloged for future use. After all, you may have to come back to it again, so any understanding is helpful. But it’s important not to waste time trying to analyze everything all at once. Remember the outcomes you’re looking to achieve. Rationalize your datasets – why are they important? Only concentrate on the data that matters for meeting your immediate objectives. Be single-minded at this stage because if you start analyzing a broad range of varied data types all at once, you’ll only end up with multiple outcomes, and none of them particularly strong. AI relies on a constant flow of robust data. You need 100% accuracy to be successful."

Implement algorithms; run a set of rules and calculations to make predictions about future outcomes. Look for patterns and behaviors. Just be aware that this process is iterative, and may require you to look for other data sources to answer the question you’re asking. Perseverance is key."

How do you operationalize and standardize them to share with the rest of your organization?"

Return to Step 1 and take stock of things before going back through the entire cycle. It’s the best way to create value and readiness for AI in the long run."

The process will also help you identify further use cases within the business where you can apply data technology and extend your overall capability. When you’re ready to adopt various components of AI, such as bots, intelligent automation, and predictive analytics, you’ll know exactly where to point your algorithms for the right outcomes, because your data is organized. But remember that as AI continues to advance, the number of things within your business which depend on data will increase. If you have high- quality data, the business value of the AI application will be equally high."
