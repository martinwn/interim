            content="Consumers have become accustomed to smartphones, mobile applications and ubiquitous connectivity, demanding a better user experience in their daily interactions. With the shift to cloud serving as the inflection point, the operating model is naturally shifting from infrastructure to everything as a service, with a focus on applications and business outcomes. Thus, enterprises are being challenged to launch a new generation of digital initiatives, including the creation of agile applications that provide rich digital experiences. Companies must focus on a business-wide — not merely an IT — transformation. They can do this by deploying modernized enterprise and cloud applications that drive shifts in reach, insight and responsiveness to the increased market pressures that threaten to drive them out of business."

            content="Enterprises are moving beyond an application landscape based on service-oriented architecture to a second generation characterized by web services, microservices, APIs, analytics and a stronger emphasis on mobility and user experience. In addition, ecosystems are emerging in which asymmetrical players are establishing a niche in the fabric of an industry. Meanwhile, underlying architectures, applications and enabling technologies are quickly evolving. As companies move forward with digital transformation, the integrated functionality of these applications and services is essential. Above all, enterprises must view the digital transformation as a businesswide transformation, not just a transformation of IT."

            content="Business leaders must not underestimate the amount of logic that lies within their legacy applications. Doing so can lead to painful outcomes, for example when attempting to move an entire SAP or Oracle portfolio into Salesforce.com. In contrast, applications can benefit from a number of maturity constructs that are happening around them, such as networks, mobility, the increasing digitization of communication and the ability to sample internet of things (IoT) data repositories."

            content="The journey to agile applications and digital experiences cannot be undertaken without a clear understanding of what technology is available and what it can do. Enterprises need to be positioned to build and deliver scalable applications that are “cloud native” and operate as microservices that can communicate via published APIs. Older applications still have value, and they need to be accessed using a service approach that is both more cost-effective and less risky than wholesale replacement."

            content="A microservices architecture fosters software development as a suite of independently deployable, lightweight modular services. Each can serve specific business goals by running unique processes, and development can be made more efficient by smaller teams working in parallel to deploy services independently. These microservices are made accessible by language- and technology-independent APIs that facilitate consumption across a diverse set of devices and foster a way to measure use. This enables companies to determine business value and even drive fee-based consumption. Moreover, APIs open up avenues for accessing critical enterprise information locked inside disparate and closed systems, as well as for the production and consumption of a broad set of valuable user stories."

IoT’s uses are endless. For example, an airline can build an IoT app that sets off an alert when a plane’s engine needs maintenance. Other possibilities include connected health, smart supply chains and automated metering of utility grids."

From predictive analytics to chatbots, AI is having a strong impact on companies, such as allowing data to be utilized in better ways and contributing to more meaningful user experiences. As the use of AI grows, the core of a business’s applications will become increasingly algorithmic. Applications will be built on efficient intelligence constructs, eventually becoming structural equation models that can be translated into something humans can more easily understand."
