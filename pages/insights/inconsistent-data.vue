            content="Master Data Management (MDM) represents a set of tools and processes used by an enterprise to consistently manage their non-transactional data. MDM is usually applied to entities like Customer, Client, Product, Account and internal reference data. MDM also enables easy maintenance of data lineage and history for audit purposes."

Using this approach, when referring to (for example) a customer within the enterprise, all systems are referring to the same customer. There are basically two reasons why there are duplicated data which are inconsistent:"

For example, the mortgage department deals with customers and manages the mortgage contracts. While the marketing department plans a promotion on mortgages. If the two departments do not cooperate (share the data), the marketing department may offer a mortgage to a customer who already has a mortgage. This is both a waste of money on the promotion as well as annoying to the customer."
