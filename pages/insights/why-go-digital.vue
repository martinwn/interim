            content="Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that keeps track of transactions in a verifiable, secured and permanent way. By design, blockchain is a decentralized technology and anything that happens on it alters all the nodes within that network. Each blockchain network consists of nodes where each node is nothing but a user’s computer or device. These nodes share digital information (basically cryptocurrencies) among themselves and that transaction gets recorded on each node in that network."

Be it online wiring, cash withdrawal or transfer through any third party wallets, the bank always acts as a mediator between the two parties. This process is centralized, where the bank has to know about each an every transaction happening between those two parties."

          <SubSection
            content="Whereas in case of Blockchain, the transaction directly happens between peers or nodes after proper approval. There is no one centralized server that handles the transaction. Each node within that large blockchain network knows that a transaction is going to occur and they keep a copy of that transaction in their distributed ledger. In its simplest form, a distributed ledger is a database held and updated independently by each participant (or node) in a large network. You might wonder how that data remains secured if each and every node is aware about that transaction? We will explore this more in-depth in the next section."

            content="In a blockchain network, each and every node is independent and acts as an Administrator. No single node can act as an owner of the entire blockchain or demand control over it. The beauty of blockchain is in decentralization. When a transaction occurs, peers are only allowed to add digital information in their distributed ledger. Once it is added, no one can edit or delete that information. Multiple transactions can occur between peers and that transaction or group of transactions is called a Block."

An in-depth detail about how blocks and blockchain actually works is given below. So now that we have understood the basics of what blockchain is, let’s take a look at the principle of Cryptoeconomics on which the entire Blockchain technology runs."

At Data Concepts, our Blockchain Specialistsand Blockchain Consultants not only focus on the technicality of cryptography but they are also well versed with the economy side of equation.

Though in real world scenarios a digital currency like Bitcoin, does not have any value, it is agreed upon by blockchain users to trust and give a certain value to that currency. Like in any economy, the concept of demand and supply also plays a very important role. Certain factors like the team handling that currency, history of that currency, performance, and many more affects the demand for these currencies."

The process of verifying or solving the transactions is called Mining. Once the transactions are solved, miners add them to the global distributed ledger (i.e to the public blockchain). Mining is not about generating new bitcoins, rather it allows blockchain to be a decentralized security."

There are many publicly available hashing algorithms available for us, and we can choose any algorithm that suits our requirements. In case of Bitcoin, SHA-256 algorithm is being used for hashing."

          <SubSection
            content="The input passed to the hashing algorithm can be anything. It can be some characters or words, spreadsheets, images, audio files or any other data. The hashing algorithm accepts that input, performs its computational logic and converts it into another form of data which usually is alphanumeric having a fixed length. Pass in the same data any number of times, and the hashing algorithm always gives you the same output. If that data is tampered, and if even a single character is changed, the entire hash gets updated and a new hash is created."

          <SubSection
            content="In the case of Blockchain, it utilizes hashing technique to know the current state of its block. All the transactions that have taken place inside a block are grouped together and a single hash is generated. The first block inside the blockchain is called the Genesis Block. The transactions inside this genesis block are hashed and saved inside this block. When the miners add the second block in the ledger, the hash of this genesis block and transactions of the second block are taken as the input for the hashing algorithm and new hash is generated. This cycle is repeated for every new block being added in the ledger and this is how the chain of blocks is formed."

            title="Digital Signature"
            content="Just like a real signature, a digital signature is used to identify a person’s identity. It helps the other party identify that the message was sent by the original party rather than coming from a hacker. A digital signature is basically a combination of key pair (Public key and Private key). Public keys are public, which means it can be shared with anyone. Whereas private keys are private and has to be kept secured by the owner. Both the keys are mathematically related to each other, in such a way that if a data is signed/encrypted by a private key, only its corresponding public key is able to decrypt it. Let’s look at an example."

          <SubSection
            content="If person A wants to send the message “DATA CONCEPTS” to person B. Person A first encrypts that message with his private key (ex: Key-(‘DATA CONCEPTS’)). This encrypted data is sent over to person B, who then uses the public key to decrypt that data. (ex: Key+(key-(‘DATA CONCEPTS’)). Since both keys are related, the message gets decrypted and the output that he receives is ‘DATA CONCEPTS’. Since the data got decrypted correctly, the receiver is ensured that the information was sent from a valid source. If the hacker had hacked the data, he would have encrypted the data using his private key, and the receiver wouldn’t have been able to open it. Ultimately making the receiver aware that the message has been tampered."

Bitcoins can be sent over to anyone anywhere in the world and anyone can generate bitcoins by using mining tools. Bitcoins can be broken down into two components, Bitcoin Token and Bitcoin Protocol. The bitcoin token is a digital code whereas bitcoin protocol is the distributed digital ledger that keeps track of all the bitcoin tokens. Bitcoins are stored in a digital wallet, which exists either in the cloud or on a user’s computer. That wallet is a kind of virtual bank account that allows users to send or receive bitcoins."

Though both of them are the applications of Blockchain technology, both differ in their purpose and capabilities. Ethereum internally uses Smart Contracts, which are like any other real world contract, except they are completely digital. It also offers its own cryptocurrency called Ether, which is used by developers to pay transaction or service fees on the Ethereum network. While miners in bitcoin application mine bitcoins, miners in Ethereum network work hard to mine Ether."

Blockchain applications like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin are examples of this kind of blockchain. As the name says, it is public and hence anyone can join the blockchain network. These blockchains are generally considered to be fully decentralized. Anyone can start a public node on their local machine and be a part of the consensus process (the process for determining what blocks are added to the chain and validating its current state). They can read/write/audit transactions without any permission."

Other nodes that accept the consensus process and are a part of this blockchain are only allowed to read transactions. Only a set of chosen/selected nodes get the authority to add new blocks, validating the transactions and make decisions for the best benefit of the whole network.

In a private blockchain, an individual or an organization is responsible for making decisions and give read/write/audit access to other nodes. Private blockchains are a way of taking advantage of blockchain technology by setting up groups and participants who can verify transactions internally. This process makes the blockchain more centralized, but it still enjoys the cryptographic security of blockchain technology."

It is worth noting that even Bitcoin has support for Smart contracts although its a lot more limited when compared to Ethereum."
