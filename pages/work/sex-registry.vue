          <li>- Statewide Sex-Offender Notification.</li>
          <li>- Radius Offender Search.</li>
          <li>- Interface with Google Maps.</li>
          <li>- Map View.</li>
          <li>- Captcha.</li>
          <li>- Supports approximately 284 hits per second.</li>
        </ul>
      </Solution>
